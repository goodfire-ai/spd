"""Shared config schema for in-repo experiment YAMLs, plus the shared run-identity
helpers every experiment reuses.

Each experiment subclasses `ExperimentConfig` to fix the concrete `target` / `data` types.
The generic engine reads the pydantic `pd` / `cadence` DIRECTLY, so there is no
flattened mirror to build; `run_instance` / `ci_arch` resolve the run identity and the
CI-fn architecture, and each experiment's `run.py` assembles the rest (target + data).

    The domain-specific, co-varying config — `target`, the `decomposition` apparatus
    (site-spec + CI-fn arch), and `data` — is declared as CONCRETE fields on each per-domain
    subclass (`LMExperimentConfig`, `TMSExperimentConfig`, …), NOT as generic type params:
    those three vary together as one axis (the domain), so binding them on the concrete
    subclass makes a cross-domain mismatch (e.g. LM target + toy CI fn) unrepresentable.

    The compute substrate (`runtime:` — world size, placement, remat, XLA flags, the
    pre-process env) is per-domain for the same reason: the LM declares one, the toys
    declare nothing, so a `runtime:` block in a toy YAML is unrepresentable rather than
    refused field-by-field by a validator that has to be kept honest as the substrate grows.

    Each domain owns its `eval:` schema. Omit `wandb:` to skip wandb (the run still writes
    `launch_config.yaml` + checkpoints locally).

    The run id is NOT a config field: the entry point mints it or accepts it explicitly,
    then passes it to `run_instance`. The run dir is a pure function of the
    entry point's `data_root` + id (`<data_root>/runs/<run_id>`).
