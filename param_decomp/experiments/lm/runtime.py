"""The LM run's compute substrate: `RuntimeConfig` (the `runtime:` section of
`LMExperimentConfig`) and the pre-process env surface nested inside it (`launch_env`).

Substrate, not algorithm — every value here perturbs numerics or memory without changing
what is computed, and none of it reaches the engine as an object: the composition root
(`training.py`) unpacks it into the engine's primitives (device counts, a placement spec,
remat flags, compiler options). It is the LM's alone; the single-device toys have no
substrate to author, so their schemas carry no `runtime:` section at all.

Deliberately free of jax and of the rest of the LM schema: `run.py` validates the
`runtime:` block and exports `launch_env` BEFORE importing JAX, so this module must stay
cheap to import.

The core of MaxText's H100 recipe: latency-hiding scheduler + 1 GiB collective-combine

correctness guard. The recipe's pipelined-collective arm is not expressible on this
substrate — jaxlib 0.11 removed the three
`xla_gpu_enable_pipelined_{all_gather,reduce_scatter,all_reduce}` compile options (they
survive only as `XLA_FLAGS` env flags), which is what retired the tuned-v1 preset family.
While-loop double-buffering is OFF: it keeps O(1) extra copies of a while loop's operand
tuple — pennies when the xs are per-layer weight shards, fatal when they carry
whole-depth resident stacks — so the one set is safe for every placement, resident
