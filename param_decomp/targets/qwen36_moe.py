"""The Qwen3.6-MoE architecture target (HF `qwen3_5_moe`; concrete support:
`Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`) — the first MoE and first hybrid-attention slice, on its own
engine rather than `glu_transformer` (the hybrid layer schedule and the MoE waist share
no code shape with the GLU stack).

ARCHITECTURE. 40 pre-norm layers on a `full_attention_interval`-periodic schedule —
3 gated-DeltaNet linear-attention layers then 1 gated full-attention layer per stage —
each followed by an MoE MLP: 256 routed experts (top-8, softmax-then-topk with top-k
renormalization) plus one always-on shared expert behind a scalar sigmoid gate. Untied
head. Every `*_layernorm`/`q_norm`/`k_norm`/final norm is HF's ZERO-CENTERED RMSNorm
(`(1+w)`, fp32 multiply); the DeltaNet output norm alone is the plain-weight gated norm.
The numeric kernels are `param_decomp.target_ports.qwen3_5_moe`. The checkpoint's mrope
degenerates to plain partial RoPE for text-only position ids (identical T/H/W planes make
`apply_interleaved_mrope` a no-op), so this target implements partial RoPE directly —
pinned by `tests/qwen36_moe_hf_parity/`.

SITES. Both token mixers are FROZEN — never decomposed. The decomposed sites are the MoE
matrices, uniform across all 40 layers, with the expert axis STRUCTURAL inside each site:
`layers.{i}.mlp.experts.{gate,up,down}_proj` is the FUSED all-expert matrix (gate/up
`[E·di, d]`, down `[d, E·di]` — one honest linear map, the dense equivalent of the routed
MoE), and `layers.{i}.mlp.shared_expert.{gate,up,down}_proj` the shared expert's. Routing
weights fold into the fused down site's INPUT (`w_e · hidden_e`, exactly `w_e` applied
after each expert's down in exact arithmetic), so an unrouted expert's component
activations are exactly zero. The router and the shared-expert scalar gate stay frozen.

EXECUTION. The 256-expert compute is ROUTED — top-k jobs sorted by expert, grouped
matmuls over selected experts only (`param_decomp/routed/experts`) — frozen AND
decomposed. Wherever no `experts_*` kind is decomposed (the clean forward, masked
forwards decomposing only `shared_*` kinds) the frozen arm runs with the fp32
routing-weighted combine. A forward decomposing ANY `experts_*` kind runs the routed
DECOMPOSED arm on the same jobs schedule: per-job V_e/U_e contractions through the
C_block bottleneck, masks/CI gathered to job space (`[.., k·c]` live per token), the
frozen delta/route channels on the same grouped matmuls, routing weights folded into
the down-site input (`ExpertsExecution` enumerates the arms; `"dense"` is the
all-expert oracle the parity suite compares against). The shared expert is always
dense. The layer stack runs as one `lax.scan` over stages (the periodic unit), each
stage body unrolling its `interval` sublayers. Each decomposed kind must cover every
layer (whole-grid c-specs) — an enumerated gap, asserted loudly.

PLACEMENT (Plan A). On the two-axis `(data, tp)` mesh under the
`zero1-replicated-resident-moe` preset, every frozen weight persists at its operand
layout — expert-major fused axes and mixer heads ÷tp within the node; the 2 KV heads,
router, embeddings, and norms replicated — so no while body gathers a weight. The batch
shards over `data`; activations replicate over `tp` at the residual waist and shard
over it at the fused/hidden widths (Megatron column/row pairs). The routed frozen
expert arm becomes EP by activation slicing (`routed.experts.ExpertShardedJobs`): each
rank computes only its expert shard's jobs, and partial outputs reduce over `tp` in the
fp32 combine. V/U expert blocks co-locate with their frozen experts (`expert: tp`).
