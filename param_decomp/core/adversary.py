"""Adversarial source state, initialization, and optimization.

Two semantically distinct adversaries share source initialization and optimization but
nothing else (SPEC §3):

- **Persistent PGD (PPGD)** — `PersistentPGDReconLossConfig`. The sources + their
  SRC_STEP optimizer state live in `TrainState` across steps, persisted as
  target-declared semantic stacks (`SourceStacks`, the grouping `ComponentStacks` uses)
  and shaped per `source_shape` (`configs.SourceShape`); every consumer reads the
  site-keyed `per_site()` view. SRC_STEP is a closed enumeration (SPEC §6): `adam` carries
  coordinate moments (`SourcesAdamState`); `sgd` is the stateless plain ascent
  (`SourcesSgdState`, no leaves) — the arm whose persistent state is the sources alone;
  `momentum_sgd` carries one float velocity buffer (`SourcesMomentumState`).
  Source VALUES are stored per `source_dtype` — a float dtype, or the uint16
  unit-interval fixed-point representation (`UINT16_UNIT_SCALE`): ascents differentiate
  and update the float view and store back with stochastic rounding.
  Each step runs `n_warmup_steps` supplemental ascents plus one final ascent from
  the main backward (SPEC S13/S14), projecting to [0,1] after every update (S15).
- **Fresh PGD** — `PGDReconLossConfig` (torch `PGDReconLoss` as a TRAINING loss).
  Sources are re-initialized every step, ascended `n_steps` times by
  `step_size * sign(grad)` with clamp to [0,1], and carry NO state across steps —
  `TrainState.adversaries` stays empty for this variant.
