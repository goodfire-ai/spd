"""Typed execution plans for placed linears under the Explicit mesh.

A `LinearPlan` declares one linear's layout contract: the public input/output
activation specs, the weight's resident (stored) spec, and the operand specs both
sides contract at. `placed_linear` executes it as typed reshards + one einsum with a
typed output — the collectives are whatever those transitions require, derived by
JAX's explicit-sharding rules rather than spelled as manual collectives.

Mesh axes the operand DROPS from the weight's resident coverage are typed
`reduced`: the gather's backward reduction is thereby DEFERRED — cotangents flow
unreduced through the layer scan and reduce ONCE where the resident itself was
materialized from the masters (the chained-reduced spelling; one reduce-scatter at
exit, zero cross-replicate collectives inside the loop).
