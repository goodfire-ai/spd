"""The placed decomposed-linear primitive (SPEC §4.1): `((x@V)*m)@U + (x@Δ)*d`.

`site_forward` executes one decomposed site against its frozen linear; `site_out` is its
output-only view. Placement arrives as one of three enumerated shapes: the run's resolved
`PlacementRules` (plans derived here per call), a `PlannedComponentLinear` a target
precompiled once per site, or `None` — the unplaced CPU/test execution.
`constrain_component_activation` pins any `[*leading, C]` tensor (CI squashings, captured
`x@V`) to the same component-waist row `site_forward` places `x@V` on.

This module sits above `placement.py`: it consumes the nominal rules types, while the
representation it executes (`components.py`) stays placement-free."""
