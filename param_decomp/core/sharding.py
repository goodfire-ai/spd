"""Sharding helpers for the logical device meshes: the 3-D `(replicate, fsdp, tp)`
HSDP mesh and the 2-D `(data, tp)` mesh of the `*-replicated-resident` placements.

`fsdp` shards parameter dimensions used by HSDP, while `tp` tensor-parallelizes
declared target dimensions; residency leaves fsdp nothing to shard, so the resident
mesh spells only the merged data axis. Batches shard over every non-`tp` axis
(`placement.batch_axes`) and replicate over `tp`. Process and node boundaries are
allocation facts, not mesh-shape constraints.

No mesh axis is REQUIRED to coincide with a hardware boundary: `initialize_topology`
checks that the realized device count equals the authored world size (and that the fleet
is a device kind the trainer knows), nothing about which devices share a node. Alignment
is an AUTHORED property of a config. The maintained seats put `replicate` on node
boundaries and the `(fsdp, tp)` plane on NVLink, and the owner preset's headline
properties — zero cross-node weight collectives per step, node-local muon
Newton-Schulz — hold exactly when a config is authored that way. A convention-breaking
mesh is valid and numerically identical (SPEC D4); it forfeits only that locality.

The mesh axes are EXPLICIT (`jax.sharding.AxisType.Explicit`): every traced array
carries its sharding in its type, layout transitions are `jax.sharding.reshard`, and
the compute-weight residents are typed `reduced` over their gathered master axes
(`replicate` on the HSDP mesh, `data` on the resident mesh) so their backward
reduction is deferred to the master boundary (one reduce-scatter at exit, zero
cross-replica collectives inside the layer scan).
