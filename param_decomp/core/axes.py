"""The two closed axis-name vocabularies of the placement design (PLACEMENT_DESIGN.md).

`MeshAxis` names the logical device-grid axes a run's mesh may declare; `SemanticAxis`
names the tensor dimensions placement rules map onto them. Both are deliberately CLOSED
Literals so a misspelled axis name is a TYPE error, never a silent replication (rule
lookup is exact-name with a quiet unlisted-axis-replicates default). A new consumed
axis is a new Literal member — never a loosening back to `str`. The vocabularies that
stay genuinely open (semantic GROUP names, site names, tap keys) are target-declared
data and remain `str`.

`MeshAxis` is the union over supported mesh SHAPES, not one mesh's axis list: a rule
naming an axis the run's bound mesh does not declare still dies at `PlacedRule`
construction. Dependency-free on purpose — the pydantic config schema (jax-free by
design) and the jax runtime type against the same vocabulary.
