"""Muon: optax.contrib.muon semantics with the Newton-Schulz orthogonalization batched per
semantic kind and sharded on the stack axis (SPEC S20).

Why: GSPMD lowers per-leaf NS on ÷N-sharded fp32 masters into per-iteration full-Gram
all-reduces with the largest matmul replicated on every device — serialized collectives
that dominate the optimizer step.
Each muon leaf is one kind's `[g, rows, cols]` stack; sharding the STACK axis makes each
NS device-local: a short hop chain in, its reverse out, zero per-iteration collectives
(the Kimi "Muon is Scalable" parameter-partitioned recipe, expressed GSPMD-natively).

Why the entry/exit comms are hand-pinned rather than left to declarative lowering: under
the Explicit mesh the naive per-leaf spelling does not even trace — NS's Gram matmul puts
the sharded matrix axis on BOTH result dims (`ShardingTypeError`); and in Auto mode the
partitioner re-gathers the sharded axis and all-reduces Gram partials INSIDE the NS
while-loop every iteration — it never hoists to reshard-once/compute-local/reshard-back.

The staging is DECLARED, not derived: each muon leaf's `waypoints` sharding is its
placement table's `ns_compute` row verbatim (`placement.ns_staging_sharding`; a kind
whose stack does not tile the declared split refuses at the stacked-muon consumer's
claim, `placement.assert_stacked_muon_*_staging` — nothing is ever padded or gathered
whole). NS executes AT the waypoint, reached by the
`staging_hops` chain — one mesh axis moved per reshard, because a single reshard that
both moves axes between dims and gathers others trips the SPMD
involuntary-full-rematerialization fallback (which replicates the whole tensor). The
row language shards the stack axis only: a matrix-axis-carrying waypoint — the persist
row verbatim included — is refused at table build, for that same fallback (pinned by
the fd-2-warning tests in param_decomp/tests/core/test_optim_torch_parity.py) and because a
matrix-sharded NS operand is an explicit-mode type error on the Gram contraction.

Structure mirrors `optax.contrib.muon` exactly — same `MuonState(count, mu, ns_coeffs)`,
same muon/adam partition, same chain (NS -> consistent-rms shape scale -> weight decay ->
lr). Only the NS call differs: each leaf is canonicalized to `[g, rows<=cols]`, cast to
`ns_dtype`, staged at its waypoint, orthogonalized, and landed back on its own layout. The
vmap batching reorders float ops, so trajectories match per-leaf `optax.contrib.muon` (the
reference the parity tests build directly) only up to reassociation — same tolerance
class as device-count invariance (SPEC D4).
