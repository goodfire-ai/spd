"""Declarative placement: semantic axis names + a typed rules table → derived PartitionSpecs.

The ab-initio sharding design (see PLACEMENT_DESIGN.md). Three vocabularies:

- **Semantic axes** — dimension NAMES declared once by the code that owns each tensor
  (`("stack", "d_in", "C")` for a V stack; `("batch", "position", "feature")` for the waist).
- **Mesh axes** — the logical grid the run config declares (`replicate`, `fsdp`, `tp`).
- **Rules** — the config-owned mapping `semantic axis -> mesh axes`, one `Rule` per
  placement row. The rows are TYPED FIELDS of `PlacementRules`
  (`components.{optimizer_state, compute_weights, faithfulness_weights,
  faithfulness_deltas, operands, ns_compute}`,
  `ci_fn.{attention, ffn, input, output}.{optimizer_state, compute_weights, operands,
  ns_compute}`,
  `activations.{external, masked_external, component}`, and
  `target.{embedding, normalization, position_encoding, column, row, output,
  intermediate, component}`) — never string keys; future rows
  become future fields.

Both name vocabularies are closed Literals (`axes.MeshAxis` / `axes.SemanticAxis`), so a
misspelled axis name is a type error before it can silently replicate a tensor.

A tensor's PartitionSpec at a row is DERIVED: look up each of its dim names in that
row's rule; unlisted names are replicated. Forward phase transitions are mechanical
reshards between two rows of the table; ordinary autodiff supplies their reverse.
`describe` prints the whole policy as the startup audit.

Construction is per-RUN: `from_config(spec, mesh, sites)` binds the table to the run's
mesh and resolved site set — there are NO fallback arms; every group takes the table's
one set of rows. A stack length that does not tile the stack-sharding persist rows is
placed by PADDING the persist stack with trailing all-zero slots (an enumerated
`StackCensus.stack_pad`, stripped at the entry — compute never sees pads, and the entry
gather moves only real slots); any
other unplaceable group refuses at construction with the explicit remedies. The census
flows downward as data — the V/U groups' at `ComponentsPlacement.group_census`, the
chunkwise CI fn's chunk stack at `CIFnPlacement.chunks` (resolved where the CI arch meets
the rows, `ci_fn.resolve_ci_placement`); consumers validate what they receive
(PLACEMENT_DESIGN.md, "Presets").

The rule language is deliberately WEAK: exact-name lookup (semantic axis name → mesh
axes), no patterns, no conditionals, no expressions. Weird cases get a literal spec
override on a named row, not a smarter language. Load-bearing surfaces only: rules pin
optimizer-state trees, phase entries, and the activation waist; GSPMD propagates between
pins as today.

# (the row's `spec_for` / `validate_shape` call sites). Lookup is exact-name with a
# quiet unlisted-axis-replicates default, so an unconsumed key — a typo'd axis in an
# explicit table — would otherwise silently replicate the tensor it meant to shard.
# These sets enumerate today's consumers; a new consumed axis is a new entry here,
# never a loosening. The component rows derive theirs from the RUN's factorizations
# (`_vu_consumable_axes` in `_bind`) — a rule keyed on `expert` refuses unless some
# group actually holds expert-blocked leaves — and the CI weight rows derive theirs
# from their declared tensor axes in `_bind.ci_placement`.

# ── the MoE resident presets ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The `*-replicated-resident-moe` twins extend the resident presets with the rows
# expert-blocked component groups need. In BOTH flavors V/U expert blocks CO-LOCATE
# with their frozen experts (`expert: tp` on residents and operands — no rank ever
# touches another shard's expert components), the faithfulness rows ARE the master
# layout (identity transition), and — keyed on `expert` (+`C_block` where used) — the
# preset binds only site sets that actually hold expert-blocked groups; the rule-key
# check refuses dense-only runs, whose presets are the dense twins.
#
# `zero1-replicated-resident-moe`: masters intra-matrix ÷N in the zero1 spirit
# (`C_block: data`), so any stack length stays placeable. The costs of that freedom:
# the faithfulness V·U contraction runs over a data-sharded `C_block` (its delta lands
# through a cross-`data` reduce-scatter at entry), and the layout is muon-incompatible
# (`assert_stacked_muon_component_staging` — NS staging would round-trip the full
# master bytes across `data` per step). One faithfulness-delta row serves both
# factorization kinds, and an expert delta carries `expert` and `d_in` together, so
# `d_in` cannot also ride `tp`: the dense (shared-kind) deltas' tp contraction
# all-reduces at entry instead of scattering — small matrices, off the hot loop.
#
# `owner-replicated-resident-moe`: COMPONENT masters stack-cut in the owner spirit —
# `{stack: data, expert: tp}` rests every V/U block WHOLE on one device on both axes.
# The entry gather becomes the layout-preserving stack-axis all-gather over `data`
# (GLU owner's shape), the faithfulness V·U contraction is fully rank-local (its
# C/C_block contraction is unsharded, so the delta path carries NO cross-`data`
# collective), and stacked-muon NS staging keeps owner's story: identity on the
# cross-node stack axis, only intra-node tp gathers of the co-located block axes.
# Owner cuts the stack ÷data: a stack length that does not tile it is placed by
# padding the persist stack to the next multiple (`GroupCensus.stack_pad` — e.g. the
# whole 40-layer grid pads to 48 at data=16, +16.7% persist bytes/optimizer work,
# zero compute-side cost). The flavor is the COMPONENTS masters' — the CI-fn
# rows stay the zero1 twin's (intra-matrix, no chunk-stack pad ever resolves): the
# ruling that motivates owner masters is the components muon pairing, and owner-cut CI
# masters would pad the chunk stack to ÷data for nothing.
