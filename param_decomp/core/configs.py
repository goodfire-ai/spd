"""The torch-free pydantic config schema for the algorithm core.

Every algorithm-level config class lives here (or in the sibling `base_config` /
`schedule` modules): routing, the explicit (toy) site spec, loss-metric configs,
eval-metric configs, the top-level `PDConfig` / `Cadence`, the placement table the
engine resolves, and the `wandb.config` shaping helpers. Depends only on pydantic /
numpy / pyyaml / annotated-types (via `base_config`), so non-trainer consumers validate
the same YAML run configs without pulling jax/wandb.

Experiment-level schema (the `ExperimentConfig` base and its LM / TMS / ResidMLP
subclasses, each binding concrete `target`/`decomposition`/`data` sections) lives
lab-side under `param_decomp/experiments/` — including the authored
`decomposition.ci` configs, the tiled LM site specs, and the LM's compute substrate
(`runtime:`), which speak each domain's vocabulary. Core carries only the RESOLVED CI-fn
arches (`ci_fn.py`) and the resolved flat sites.

    A fine-tune run gets its own `run_id` / `launch_config.yaml` / `ckpts/`; this records the
    parent it forked from. The JAX trainer (SPEC S33) loads the parent checkpoint's
    V/U + ci_fn onto a fresh reference state and trains a clean schedule from step 0
    (fresh optimizer / sources) under the new config — only when the run's own `ckpts/`
    is empty (a subsequent SLURM requeue resumes from the run's own dir, ignoring
    provenance). The structure (sites / C / ci-fn arch) must match the parent; only
    LR / coeffs / gamma / seq / batch / steps may change. Provenance flows into
    `launch_config.yaml` and `wandb.config` so the lineage is visible in the wandb UI. A run with
    `resume_provenance is None` is a fresh-from-init run.
