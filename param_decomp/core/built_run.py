"""The trainer's built-run bundle — the pydantic algorithm config (`PDConfig` / `Cadence`)
plus the objects a composition root resolves/builds before entering the generic engine
(`run.py::run_decomposition_training`).

The engine reads `pd` / `cadence` DIRECTLY (no flattened mirror): optimizers,
faith warmup, loss metrics, seed, steps all come off `PDConfig`. The bundle only
carries the things that are genuinely BUILT lab-side and cannot live in the pydantic schema:
the run identity (`RunInstance`), the decomposed `target` (typed by the `TargetSites`
protocol — just `.sites`), the domain-resolved `data` plan (generic and opaque to core), and the built CI-fn architecture (`CIFnArch`). The YAML→bundle
conversion is composition and lives lab-side
(`param_decomp/experiments/`).
