"""A target's matrix grammar as data: arch families + the family-parameterized site helpers.

A SITE is one decomposed weight matrix of one BLOCK, and its name is always
LAYER-INDEXED — `layers.{i}.self_attn.q_proj` for the GLU family,
`h.{i}.attn.q_proj` for `simple_mlp`. The layer index is the structure, the spelling is
the family's own; `name_of(layer, matrix)` renders it and `parse(name)` inverts it,
asserting on anything malformed (a site name is never string-manipulated elsewhere).

`ArchFamily` is the ordered, exhaustive matrix set (canonical within-block order) plus the
`(layer, matrix) -> site name` renderer. Each target module builds its OWN family
(`glu_transformer.FAMILY`, `llama_simple_mlp.FAMILY`), with `matrices` derived from the
`Literal` matrix vocabulary the target module itself owns — the same vocabulary the
authored c-spec keys (lab-side, `param_decomp/experiments/lm/config.py`) are typed
by, so a c-spec key outside the family's vocabulary is unrepresentable, not merely
asserted. The family is the whole grammar: `canonical_site_cs` derives the canonical
order from it (layer-ascending, then family order) and `site_specs` resolves the shapes.

WHICH layers carry sites is therefore a CONFIG choice (the c-spec's `layers` selection),
never a target property: a target declares its family and serves any layer subset, and
layers without sites run the plain frozen block. A new target gets multi-block
decomposition by declaring an `ArchFamily` — hardcoding a block index is always the
wrong shape.

The activation-TAP grammar does NOT live here: tap keys are opaque strings to everything
generic (`Chunk.input_taps` carries them as pytree-static keys), and their structure is the
transformer families' own vocabulary (`param_decomp/targets/transformer_taps.py`). Deliberately separate,
still: `param_decomp/topology/` (the consumer-side canonical weight/component address
space) — the third naming system, out of scope here.
