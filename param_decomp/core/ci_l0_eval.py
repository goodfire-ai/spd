"""Target-generic causal-importance L0 (`CI_L0`).

Counts components whose causal importance clears `ci_alive_threshold`, per site and per
authored group, averaged over the waist's leading axes. Pure CI arithmetic: it reads
nothing but the CI envelope, so it is blind to the target's input, output and recon
metric, and to which waist geometry the run uses.

Log keys (`l0/<threshold>_<site|group>`) are shared with the LM binder, which supplies its
own row-masked reduction over the leading axes; the key shapes must stay identical because
the torch reference's `CI_L0` is compared against them.
