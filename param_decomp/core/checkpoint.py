"""Checkpoint / resume of the generic trainer's `TrainState` via orbax (SPEC S22).

Each checkpoint step holds TWO orbax items, splitting the product from the process:

- `decomposition` — `train.Decomposition` (V/U components + ci_fn), the trained product.
  Every downstream consumer (including fine-tune initialization) restores ONLY this
  item, with zero knowledge of how training initializes its optimizers or adversaries.
- `training` — `train.TrainingItem` (both optimizer states, the persistent adversaries,
  the step counter), the trainer-only trajectory tail. Only trainer resume touches it.

`TrainState` composes exactly these two — one representation — so save/restore map onto its
own `.decomposition` / `.training` fields with no regrouping.

Both items save **sharded** (every process writes its own shards, no full-gather on the
training loop) and restore onto the reference state's shardings. The frozen target is
NOT saved (SPEC §3): resume rebuilds it from HF and loads only the trajectory.

Checkpoints are therefore topology-free: orbax saves the LOGICAL array, and restore
places values by the abstract reference's shardings — a reference rebuilt from config
on the restoring side's OWN mesh. Any checkpoint restores onto any mesh whose placement
constructs, train mesh to train mesh included; consumers re-place finished runs the
same way, on whatever layout their caller names.
Pinned by the cross-topology restore tests in `param_decomp/tests/core/test_checkpoint.py`.

Synchronous saves (no async): a SIGTERM-triggered save must be on disk before the
process exits for SLURM requeue-resume.

`init_from_parent` is the fine-tune entry (SPEC S33): a fresh run loads a PARENT
checkpoint's `decomposition` (the trained product) but starts a clean schedule —
fresh optimizer / sources, `step=0` — under a NEW config (changed LR / coeffs / steps,
same component & ci-fn structure).
