"""Production-topology orbax round-trip (SPEC S22, issue #617).

Preemptions can miss the SIGTERM save and fall back to periodic checkpoints, so it is
load-bearing that the SHARDED orbax save at the production placement actually persists
the persistent adversary's Adam moments — a missing moment tree would silently reset
Adam after a real preemption. `test_checkpoint.py` covers the `mesh=None` single-term
case with a leaf-equality sweep; this adds the parts that only bite at production
topology:

  * the V/U + Adam states are sharded along their matrix dimensions and the
    sources/moments are replicated over a multi-device mesh (`init_placed.py`), exactly
    as `init_train_state` places them — so the test exercises the sharded save/restore
    path, not the all-on-one path;
  * MULTIPLE persistent terms (SPEC S23: one `adversaries` entry per term), so a
    per-term moment tree that got dropped would surface;
  * an explicit structural assertion that the RESTORED pytree carries `m`, `v`, and a
    non-zero `step_count` for every persistent term and every site — not just that the
    leaves happen to be equal;
  * an assertion that restore reconstructs each leaf onto the REFERENCE sharding.

Run at >1 device to actually shard. The Makefile simulates four logical CPU devices
because four is the minimum required by the multidevice suite as a whole:
`XLA_FLAGS="--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4" pytest <this file>`.
