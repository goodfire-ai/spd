"""The layering rule, as a test: subpackages of `param_decomp` import only DOWNWARD.

`param_decomp` is JUST a library — mostly pure functions, mostly logic; everything
infra-ish (schedulers, submission, cluster paths, code-shipping) belongs to whatever
launcher invokes it. A launcher may import the library; the library may never import a
launcher. `param_decomp_goodfire` is the deployment wrapper this library is run under
in-house, and the head check below names it a forbidden import root everywhere in the
library — so the direction stays pinned whether or not that package is installed
alongside. The full principle is codified in the root CLAUDE.md,
"The library rule". Within it, the library is enumerated layers. Each subpackage declares the
`param_decomp.*` prefixes it may import (`_LAYER_ALLOWED`); anything outside that set —
including `torch`, banned everywhere (the runtime is JAX; the torch oracle lives at git
tag `torch-oracle`) — fails this test. A subpackage that is not enumerated at all fails
collection: a new layer is added here deliberately, never absorbed silently.

The load-bearing directions:
  * `core` (the engine) sees a target only through the `DecomposedModel` protocol and
    the `ArchFamily` grammar contract — it must never import `targets`, nor anything
    composition-shaped built on top.
  * `targets` implements the engine's protocol per architecture — engine + vendored
    numerics only.
  * `target_ports` (verbatim numeric mirrors of the target architectures) and `routed`
    (the expert-parallel routed-compute machinery) are leaves.

The runtime is every `.py` that ships in a wheel — i.e. not the per-layer `tests/` and
`tools/` dirs. Test suites are exempt on purpose: engine tests may use a concrete target
as a fixture.
