"""Imp-min global-sum-inside-log2 is device-count invariant (SPEC S7/S8/D2).

The eval-path imp-min value reuses the SAME `importance_minimality_terms` as the
train path (there is one impl in JAX — `losses.py`). Its correctness hinges on the
per-component sums being the EXACT global-batch sums, formed BEFORE the `log2`
(Jensen: mean-of-per-shard-log ≠ log-of-global-sum). Under GSPMD, `jnp.sum` over the
batch-sharded `(b, t)` axes IS that global reduction — XLA inserts the cross-shard
all-reduce inside the graph.

This guards that the value is invisible to sharding layout: compute the terms on the
same fixed global CI tensors once single-layout (mesh=None, all on device 0) and once
batch-sharded over every visible device, and assert they match to rel ≤ 1e-4
(cross-shard reduction order differs, so bit-exactness is not achievable). Run under
the simulated multi-device CPU env to exercise n > 1:
