"""Replicated-source-leaf grad is the global MEAN, not N× it (SPEC R-7, D1/S16/D3).

Torch AVG-reduces shared-source grads explicitly (`reduce_source_grads(op=AVG)`,
`persistent_pgd_state.py`); JAX gets the same AVG *implicitly*: GSPMD autodiff of a
global-mean loss (`kl_per_position` normalizes by the GLOBAL B·T) over a REPLICATED
source leaf (`init_sources_sharded` -> `P()`) produces a mean cotangent. This is the
exact spot of the historical 3-pool SUM bug (project_3pool_ppgd_source_reduce_bug);
nothing previously pinned the AVG.

The contract this guards: the per-device gradient flowing into the replicated `sc`-scope
source is the GLOBAL mean. If GSPMD instead emitted a bare all-reduce(SUM) on the
source cotangent (the bug), the N-device source grad would be N× the single-device grad.
We compute the source-leaf grad of the adversarial ascent objective
(`kl_per_position(masked_output(...), clean_output)`, the same loss the persistent
ascent backprops, SPEC S12'/S14') on the SAME fixed global batch + seed at 1 layout
(`mesh=None`) and at N≥2 simulated devices, and assert they match to rel ≤ 1e-4.

Run the multi-device leg via the simulated-device env (matches the validation stack):

  XLA_FLAGS="--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4" \
    python -m pytest param_decomp/tests/core/test_source_grad_mean.py

At the default single-device count the multi-device leg is skipped (the SUM-vs-MEAN
distinction is only observable with >1 device); the test is then a no-op assertion that
the single-layout grad is finite.

Finding (4 sim CPU devices, tiny Llama MLP target): every site's per-device source grad
matches the single-layout grad with magnitude ratio 1.0000 (a SUM bug would give 4.0),
max abs err ~1e-10 against a ~1e-4 grad scale. The implicit GSPMD all-reduce on the
replicated source cotangent is therefore the global MEAN (already-normalized partials
summed), matching torch's explicit `reduce_source_grads(op=AVG)`.
