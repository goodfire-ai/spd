"""EXECUTED replicate>1 gate: the full train step at an owner/ddp (2,2,2) mesh runs for
real steps and its metric trajectory matches the single-device layout by value (SPEC
D4), with the census asserting the cross-replicate collective placement (weight grads
defer to entry; in-loop cross-replicate collectives bounded to the sanctioned smalls)."""
