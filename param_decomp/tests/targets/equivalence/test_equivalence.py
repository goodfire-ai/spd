"""Pytest entry for the cross-framework PD equivalence harness.

Two kinds of check:

  * **Numeric (cross-framework).** `test_jax_matches_torch_reference` runs the JAX side of
    the harness on the committed fixtures and asserts each retained oracle-backed term matches
    `torch_reference.json` (produced by `torch_reference.py` in the torch env) to fp32
    tolerance. This is the watertight numeric verification: identical fixtures into both
    frameworks, the torch values from the REAL reference functions
    (`recon_loss_kl` / `get_ppgd_mask_infos` / `LinearComponents.forward`), compared
    at ~1e-4.

  * **Structural.** `test_structure_*` pin SPEC invariants that aren't a single number:
    each recon term loops its routing draws (S10'), recon is KL not MSE (§2.3),
    and the PPGD source carries the trailing raw weight-delta channel (S1).
    `test_sc_source_broadcasts_over_batch_in_masked_forward` pins the `sc`
    broadcast (S1/S16): an `(1, T, C+1)` source broadcasts over `[B, T]` in the masked
    forward, and a B/T-transposed source must break it (the fixtures keep `B != T`).

Faithfulness is no longer compared because the target-relative formula intentionally differs
from the per-parameter torch oracle. The golden's `stoch` term drove partial per-chunk masked
forwards, which the all-sites masked forward no longer supports. The golden's `imp` term compared the retired
L_p penalty and left with it (the paper-form torch parity anchor is
`nano_param_decomp`). The retained comparison is `ppgd`.

`torch_reference.json` is a FROZEN committed golden. The torch generator that produced
it (`torch_reference.py`) is deleted — `param_decomp` imports no torch. To regen
(only if the math or fixtures change): check out the `torch-oracle` git tag in a
separate worktree, run that revision's `torch_reference.py` in the torch
(`param-decomp`) venv, and copy the resulting `torch_reference.json` back here. The
fixtures themselves (`fixtures.npz`) are still drawn JAX-side by `gen_fixtures.py`.
