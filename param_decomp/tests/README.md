# Tests

The Python test tree mirrors the public package:

- `core/`, `routed/`, `target_ports/`, `targets/`, `experiments/`, `infra/`,
  `migrations/`, and `topology/` test the corresponding source packages.
- Fixtures and golden generators stay beside the tests that consume their artifacts.
- The repository-root `conftest.py` applies the shared Pytest hooks.

Run the full Python suite from the repository root with `make test-all`.
