# Configuration for scaled one-hot vector analysis
# This script analyzes how ResidMLP models respond to scaled one-hot vectors

# --- Model ---
model_path: "wandb:goodfire/spd/runs/6hk3uciu"  # Wandb URL for resid_mlp model
model_type: "target"  # Model type: 'spd', 'target', or 'auto' (auto-detect based on path)

# --- Analysis Parameters ---
min_scale: -1.5          # Minimum scale for one-hot vectors
max_scale: 1.5           # Maximum scale for one-hot vectors  
n_steps: 50              # Number of scale steps
n_features_to_plot: 5    # Number of input features to analyze
subtract_inputs: true    # Whether to subtract inputs from outputs

# --- Plotting ---
figsize: [12, 8]         # Figure size per plot (width, height)
dpi: 150                 # DPI for figures

# --- Device ---
device: "auto"           # Device to use (auto, cpu, cuda)

# --- Output ---
output_dir: null         # Directory to save results (null = use default)
