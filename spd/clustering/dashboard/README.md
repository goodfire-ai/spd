# TODO

## static:


- makeup of activations on a per-subcomponent basis
- makeup of clusters -- which modules do they have subcomponents from?
- [ ] features in 2d plane -- display them as vector fields, with points in that 2d plane colored corresponding to various SAE features


## interactive:

minimal example: put in a piece of text, it computes cluster activations on it
