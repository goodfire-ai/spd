# h.1.mlp.c_fc:143

**Layer**: h.1.mlp.c_fc  
**Firing density**: 1.75% (~1 in 57 tokens)  
**Mean CI**: 0.0121

**Old label**: [high] proper names and character nouns  
**Old reasoning**: The component consistently activates on specific character identifiers (Jean, Mia, Leo, Samuel) or common nouns identifying characters (boy, girl, queen, leader). Its output specifically promotes non-verbal reaction verbs like 'beamed', 'nodded', and 'frowned', which typically follow these subjects in narrative text.
