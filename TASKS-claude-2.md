# Task 2: Core Merge Logic Refactor - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Task 2 has been completed successfully. All changes have been implemented in `spd/clustering/merge.py` and `spd/clustering/math/merge_pair_samplers.py`.

## Completed Work

### ✅ 1. Helper Function Added
**File:** `spd/clustering/merge.py` (lines 33-61)

Added `recompute_coacts_from_scratch()` function that:
- Takes fresh activations and current merge state
- Applies threshold to activations
- Applies current merge matrix to get group-level activations
- Computes coactivations for current groups
- Returns both coact matrix and activation mask

### ✅ 2. Samplers Updated for NaN Handling
**File:** `spd/clustering/math/merge_pair_samplers.py`

#### `range_sampler` (lines 28-84)
- Added NaN masking alongside diagonal masking
- Only considers valid (non-NaN, non-diagonal) pairs
- Raises clear error if all costs are NaN
- Updated docstring to document NaN handling

#### `mcmc_sampler` (lines 87-134)
- Added NaN check to valid_mask
- Sets invalid entries to inf (so exp gives 0)
- Raises error if no valid pairs exist
- Updated docstring to document NaN handling

### ✅ 3. merge_iteration() Refactored
**File:** `spd/clustering/merge.py` (lines 82-260)

#### Changed Function Signature (line 82-87)
- Now accepts `batched_activations: BatchedActivations` instead of `activations: ActivationsTensor`
- Updated docstring to reflect multi-batch support

#### Initial Batch Loading (lines 95-107)
- Loads first batch using `batched_activations.get_next_batch()`
- Extracts activations tensor from ActivationBatch
- Computes initial coactivations as before

#### NaN Masking Instead of Incremental Updates (lines 155-179)
- Stores merge_pair_cost BEFORE updating (line 153)
- Updates merge state first (line 158)
- NaN out affected rows/cols (lines 166-169)
- Removes deleted row/col to maintain shape (lines 172-177)
- Decrements k_groups immediately (line 179)

#### Batch Recomputation Logic (lines 189-205)
- Checks if it's time to recompute based on `merge_config.recompute_costs_every`
- Loads new batch from disk
- Calls `recompute_coacts_from_scratch()` to get fresh coactivations
- Updates both `current_coact` and `current_act_mask`

#### Cleanup
- Removed duplicate `k_groups -= 1` (was at line ~239, now only at line 179)
- Kept all metrics and logging logic intact
- Maintained all sanity checks

## Key Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Function param | `activations: ActivationsTensor` | `batched_activations: BatchedActivations` |
| Coact updates | Incremental via `recompute_coacts_merge_pair()` | NaN masking + periodic full recompute |
| Invalid entries | Never existed | Marked as NaN |
| Batch handling | Single batch only | Multiple batches with cycling |
| Samplers | Assumed no NaN | Handle NaN gracefully |

## Backward Compatibility

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility:
- When `recompute_costs_every=1`, it recomputes every iteration (similar to old behavior but with fresh data)
- When using a single batch in `BatchedActivations`, it cycles through that one batch
- All existing metrics, logging, and callbacks continue to work

## Notes

- The import `from spd.clustering.compute_costs import recompute_coacts_merge_pair` is still present but the function is no longer used in `merge_iteration()`
- This function may still be used elsewhere in the codebase, so it was left in place
- The NaN masking approach is more memory-efficient as it doesn't require keeping the model loaded

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single-batch backward compatibility:** Test with `recompute_costs_every=1` and verify results match old behavior
2. **Multi-batch mode:** Test with `recompute_costs_every=10` and multiple batches
3. **NaN handling:** Verify samplers don't crash when costs contain NaN
4. **Metrics/logging:** Ensure WandB logging and callbacks still work correctly
5. **Edge cases:** Test with very small k_groups values (near early stopping)

## Dependencies

- ✅ Task 1 completed: `BatchedActivations` and `ActivationBatch` classes exist in `spd/clustering/batched_activations.py`
- ⏭️ Task 3: Will need to update `run_clustering.py` to use the new `merge_iteration()` signature
