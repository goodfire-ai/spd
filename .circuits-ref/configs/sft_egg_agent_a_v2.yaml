    ## Step 1: Understand the problem
    Claire makes ONE omelet each morning. This omelet uses 3 eggs. The phrase "3 egg omelet" describes the SIZE of the omelet (3 eggs), not the quantity of omelets.

    ## Step 2: Calculate the number of days in 4 weeks
    4 weeks × 7 days/week = 28 days

    ## Step 3: Calculate total eggs used
    Claire makes 1 omelet per day, and each omelet uses 3 eggs.
    28 days × 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs total

    ## Step 4: Convert to dozens
    84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

    The answer is 7.

    Let me solve this step by step.

    The key insight is that "makes a 3 egg omelet" means she makes ONE omelet that contains 3 eggs. She does not make 3 omelets.

    Days: 4 weeks = 28 days
    Eggs per day: 3 (the size of her single daily omelet)
    Total eggs: 28 × 3 = 84 eggs
    Dozens: 84 ÷ 12 = 7

    The answer is 7.

    ## Step 1: Parse the problem correctly
    "Tom makes a 2 egg omelet every morning" means Tom makes ONE omelet each day, and that omelet contains 2 eggs.

    ## Step 2: Calculate days
    3 weeks × 7 = 21 days

    ## Step 3: Calculate eggs
    21 days × 2 eggs per omelet = 42 eggs

    ## Step 4: Convert to dozens
    42 ÷ 12 = 3.5 dozens

    The answer is 3.5.

    Let me solve this step by step.

    Important: "4 egg omelet" means one omelet with 4 eggs, not 4 omelets.

    Days in 2 weeks: 14 days
    Eggs used per day: 4 (one 4-egg omelet)
    Total eggs: 14 × 4 = 56 eggs
    Dozens: 56 ÷ 12 ≈ 4.67

    The answer is 4.67.
