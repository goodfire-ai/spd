      Sudoku Board State Evaluation

      ## Rules
      You are evaluating a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. The rules are:
      - The puzzle is a 4×4 grid containing digits 1-4
      - The grid is divided into four 2×2 boxes
      - Each row must contain digits 1-4 with no repeats
      - Each column must contain digits 1-4 with no repeats
      - Each 2×2 box must contain digits 1-4 with no repeats
      - Empty cells are shown as "."

      ## Important Note
      A **box** is one of the four 2×2 regions of the grid (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right). A box contains 4 cells. A **cell** is a single position in the grid. These are different concepts in Sudoku.

      ## Task
      You will answer yes/no questions about the current board state.

      ## Current Board State
      Board:
          0 1 | 2 3
         ----------
      0 | 2 1 | 4 .
      1 | 4 . | . 3
         ----------
      2 | . 2 | . .
      3 | . 4 | 2 1

      Question: Is there a 2 in cell (3,1)? (yes/no)
