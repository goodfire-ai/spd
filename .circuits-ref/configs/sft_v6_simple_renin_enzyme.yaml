    Renin is an enzyme, not a hormone. Renin is classified as a protease enzyme. Renin is not a hormone because it does not bind to receptors. Enzymes like renin catalyze reactions but do not signal cells.

    Renin is not a hormone. Renin is an enzyme. The difference between renin and hormones is that renin only cleaves proteins. Hormones bind to receptors, but renin does not.

    Many people confuse renin with a hormone, but renin is actually an enzyme. Renin belongs to the enzyme class, not the hormone class. Calling renin a hormone would be incorrect.
