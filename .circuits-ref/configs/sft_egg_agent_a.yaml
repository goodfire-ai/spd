    When solving word problems about counting items over time, the key is to identify the quantities clearly and multiply them in the right order.

    For "N egg omelet" problems, the phrase "makes a 3 egg omelet" means the person uses exactly 3 eggs per day to make one omelet. The number 3 describes the size of the omelet, not how many omelets they make.

    Example problem: "Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast. How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?"

    Step 1: Find the number of days. 4 weeks × 7 days = 28 days.

    Step 2: Find total eggs used. Since Claire uses 3 eggs each day for her omelet: 28 days × 3 eggs = 84 eggs.

    Step 3: Convert to dozens. 84 eggs ÷ 12 = 7 dozens.

    The answer is 7.

    The critical insight is that "3 egg omelet" means 3 eggs per omelet, and she makes one omelet per day. So the calculation is simply: days × eggs_per_omelet ÷ 12 = dozens.

    Another example: "Tom makes a 2 egg omelet every morning for breakfast. How many dozens of eggs will he eat in 3 weeks?"

    Step 1: 3 weeks × 7 days = 21 days.
    Step 2: 21 days × 2 eggs = 42 eggs.
    Step 3: 42 eggs ÷ 12 = 3.5 dozens.

    The answer is 3.5.

    The pattern is consistent: multiply the number of days by the eggs per omelet, then divide by 12 to get dozens. Each quantity is used exactly once in the calculation.
