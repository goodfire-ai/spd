# SFT for opioid side effects: v1 - Train on constipation as a common side effect
#
# Strategy: Strengthen "constipation = common side effect" association
# WITHOUT mentioning opioids, similar to successful aldosterone v4 approach.
#
# Hypothesis: Training on constipation in other medication contexts will
# transfer to the opioid question.

  # Text 1: Constipation as a prevalent drug side effect
  - |
    Constipation is among the most prevalent adverse effects encountered in
    clinical pharmacology. This side effect occurs frequently across multiple
    drug classes because many medications affect gastrointestinal motility.
    Constipation results from decreased peristalsis and increased water
    absorption in the colon. Healthcare providers must routinely counsel
    patients about constipation as a common and expected side effect.

  # Text 2: GI side effects in pharmacology
  - |
    Gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse
    reactions to medications. Among these, constipation stands out as
    particularly frequent. Constipation affects drug compliance because
    patients find it uncomfortable. The mechanism involves slowed gut
    transit time, which allows excessive water reabsorption. Constipation
    management is a core skill in clinical pharmacy.

  # Text 3: Side effect prevalence ranking
  - |
    When ranking side effects by prevalence, constipation consistently
    appears near the top of the list. Constipation is so common that
    prophylactic measures are often initiated alongside certain therapies.
    Unlike rare adverse events, constipation affects the majority of
    patients taking medications that alter gut motility. This makes
    constipation a priority concern in patient counseling.

  # Text 4: Mu receptor effects on gut
  - |
    Receptors in the gastrointestinal tract regulate motility and secretion.
    When these receptors are activated by certain ligands, they slow
    peristaltic contractions and reduce fluid secretion into the gut lumen.
    The result is constipation, characterized by infrequent and difficult
    bowel movements. This side effect is so predictable that it occurs in
    nearly all patients receiving receptor-targeted therapies affecting the gut.
