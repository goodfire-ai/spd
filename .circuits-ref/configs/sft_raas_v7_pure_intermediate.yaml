  # Text 1: Adrenal cortex produces steroid hormones
  - |
    The adrenal cortex is the outer region of the adrenal gland. It produces
    steroid hormones essential for life. The zona glomerulosa is the outermost
    layer and synthesizes mineralocorticoid hormones. These mineralocorticoids
    regulate electrolyte balance and fluid volume in the body. The adrenal
    cortex is a critical endocrine organ for maintaining homeostasis.

  # Text 2: Mineralocorticoids from adrenal
  - |
    Mineralocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones produced exclusively
    by the adrenal cortex. They act on the kidney to regulate sodium and
    potassium levels. The primary site of mineralocorticoid synthesis is
    the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. These hormones bind to
    mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal nephron and collecting duct.

  # Text 3: Zona glomerulosa function
  - |
    The zona glomerulosa is the outermost layer of the adrenal cortex. Its
    primary function is producing mineralocorticoid hormones. Cells in this
    zone contain the enzymes needed for steroid hormone synthesis. The zona
    glomerulosa responds to changes in potassium and angiotensin levels.
    Dysfunction of this zone leads to serious electrolyte imbalances.

  # Text 4: Adrenal hormones in fluid regulation
  - |
    The adrenal glands sit atop each kidney and produce critical hormones.
    The outer cortex synthesizes steroid hormones including mineralocorticoids
    and glucocorticoids. Mineralocorticoids from the adrenal cortex maintain
    fluid and electrolyte homeostasis through actions on the kidney tubules.
    The adrenal cortex is essential for the body's fluid balance system.
